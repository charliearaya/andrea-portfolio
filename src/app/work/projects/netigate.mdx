### Establishing Design Structure During Scale-Up

I joined Netigate during a scale-up phase marked by steady growth and increasing marketing activity. At the time, design efforts were primarily focused on the product, and the marketing team did not have a dedicated designer. As a result, marketing materials had been produced over time by different teams and stakeholders, leading to varied visual expressions and a lack of overall structure.

There was a clear need to create stronger alignment between product and marketing, establish brand consistency across marketing touchpoints, and introduce a more systematic approach to design as the organisation matured.

### Marketing Material
As Netigate scaled, the biggest challenge was to align the brand consistently across the entire organisation — and do it fast. The sales team needed up-to-date, easy-to-use materials they could quickly adapt and send out, while marketing required assets across multiple channels.

I worked with PowerPoint templates to support sales, ensuring materials were accessible, flexible, and on-brand. In parallel, I collaborated closely with the marketing manager to design and set up LinkedIn ads, Google ads, brochures, and campaign assets. 

For the website, I worked hand in hand with a web developer to translate the brand guidelines into a consistent digital experience.

Throughout this work, I acted as a connective layer between marketing, sales, and product, continuously aligning marketing output with the product design system. My role was not only to produce assets, but to bring teams together around a shared brand direction and enable faster, more consistent communication at scale.

### Office Photoshoot & Brand Imagery
To create more authentic, on-brand imagery, I initiated and organised an office photoshoot focused on capturing Netigate’s people and culture. Since the product centers on human feedback and collaboration, I wanted the imagery to reflect real interactions and a sense of togetherness.

I collaborated with a photographer and planned the shoot end to end — defining settings, coordinating time slots, and arranging group compositions. The resulting images were well received across the company and helped strengthen both external brand expression and internal pride.

### Brand Documentation
To ensure long-term consistency and scalability, I consolidated all decisions into a brand documentation, refining and formalising the brand guidelines. 

This documentation captured visual principles, usage rules, and examples across marketing touchpoints, making the brand easy to apply, maintain, and evolve.

By “locking in” the work, the guidelines became a shared reference for marketing, sales, product, and external partners — supporting brand consistency, faster execution, and increased design maturity across the organisation.

## Aligning Product and Marketing Through Design
By introducing marketing brand guidelines aligned with the product design system, brand consistency across marketing touchpoints was significantly improved. Design maturity increased as teams moved from ad hoc decisions to shared principles, enabling clearer collaboration between product and marketing and providing a scalable foundation for coherent, confident communication.
