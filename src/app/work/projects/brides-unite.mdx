### Designing with Grids and Typography

As part of my graphic design studies, I developed a wedding magazine concept where typography served as the core design element. 

The project focused on learning how to construct a magazine from the ground up - working with grid systems, layout structure, and typographic hierarchy.

#### Handwritten Elements
Throughout the magazine, I incorporated handwritten typographic elements to bring a personal, expressive layer to the otherwise structured layout. Before digitizing them, I created all the lettering by hand so the final assets preserved the character of my own handwriting. Used selectively across pages, these touches added warmth and individuality while still fitting within the overall editorial system.

## Grid System
The layout was built on a strict grid system to maintain structure and readability. It provided a clear framework for balancing text, images, and handwritten elements, ensuring consistency across all spreads while still allowing room for expressive typographic moments.

## Understanding Editorial Rhythm and Hierarchy
This project strengthened my understanding of typographic fundamentals — spacing, rhythm, hierarchy, and readability — principles that continue to inform my UI work today, particularly in structuring content, establishing visual hierarchy, and designing text-driven interfaces.
