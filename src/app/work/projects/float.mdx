## Shaping Early-Stage Products
I worked at VNTRS, a Stockholm-based venture studio that helps startups build and scale digital products. As part of a cross-functional team (UX, UI, PM and developers), we collaborated closely with the founders of Float, a startup, to refresh their brand and redesign both the website and product interface.

## The Challenge

When Float launched its financial product in spring 2022, the company grew quickly. But most new customers needed hands-on guidance to complete the sign-up process.

This heavy reliance on human interaction created friction and made scaling unsustainable. Float turned to our team at VNTRS to help streamline the experience and improve client conversion.

## Empathize with user

We assessed the performance of Float’s website and product experience, focusing on both UX and UI. Through a mix of user interviews and usability testing, we uncovered key pain points and opportunities in the existing journey.

## Brand-Driven Optimization for Growth

We evolved the website design to build stronger brand recognition and support business goals. By clarifying visual hierarchy, reinforcing messaging, and optimizing key touchpoints, we improved the user journey and increased conversion potential.

## Building a Scalable Design System

To support both the website and product interface, we developed a modular design system that streamlined UI development, improved visual consistency, and enabled faster iteration across teams. The system defined components, patterns, typography, and color usage, ensuring every touchpoint reflected one unified brand.

## Improving Conversion, Usability, and Trust
We iterated on the design of the website to optimize for user conversion and brand experience. In the product our focus was to elevate the usability in the onboarding and create more trust. VNTRS is continually helping to improve Floats product and make refinements as we go.
