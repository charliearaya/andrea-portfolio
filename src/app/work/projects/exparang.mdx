## Designing Under Tight Constraints
While employed at VNTRS, I supported Exparang — a Stockholm-based HR-tech startup that connects senior professionals with leadership and advisory roles through a privacy-driven matching platform.

In this project, I worked independently from VNTRS and collaborated with an external development team. Because Exparang had limited resources, my time on the project was minimal, which led us to focus on a few high-impact priorities.

## Challenge

With limited design time and several areas needing improvement, the challenge was to identify the highest-impact issues and address the most urgent pain points.

<ol>
  <li>Inefficient Onboarding</li>
  <span>
    The onboarding flow required extensive information without the ability to save progress. Users who left the process had to start over, leading to frustration and high drop-off risk.
  </span>
  <br />
  <br />

  <li>Unclear Product Structure</li>
  <span>
    Navigation, information architecture, and user flows were not well defined. This made it difficult for users to understand where they were in the product or how to complete key tasks.
  </span>
  <br />
  <br />

  <li>Outdated Visual Design </li>
  <span>
    The interface needed a visual refresh, but the scope allowed only for targeted polish. The focus was on improving hierarchy, consistency, and overall clarity.
  </span>
</ol>

### Onboarding Impovements

I redesigned the onboarding by reducing the initial steps to only the essential information needed to create an account. This addressed the high drop-off caused by asking users to complete their full profile upfront.

<br />
<br />
Exparang relies on detailed user data to generate meaningful matches, so we needed a way to encourage users to complete their profiles without overwhelming them during signup. We implemented:

<ul>
  <li>
    A progress bar to show remaining steps
  </li>
  <li>
    A final onboarding step with a clear call-to-action to complete the profile
  </li>
  <li>
    Seamless transition into the tool, saving all progress
  </li>
</ul>


This allowed users to register quickly, guided them to finish their profiles, improved completion rates, reduced frustration, and ensured we collected the data needed for relevant matches.

### Navigation & Structure Improvements
To bring clarity to the product, I introduced a left-side navigation. This gives users a stable structure, makes key sections visible immediately, and scales better than the previous layout.

Building on the onboarding flow, the home dashboard now highlights the most important action: completing the profile. Since matches depend on this information, users are guided to finish their profile right after signup, preventing confusion and empty results.

### Visual Design
I introduced a lightweight design system built around essentials - color, typography, and key components like CTAs. These basics created a clearer visual hierarchy, consistent patterns, and a more purposeful overall experience.

## High-Impact Improvements with Minimal Change
By focusing on the most impactful UX issues, I streamlined key flows, clarified the product structure, and introduced a minimal design system to unify the visual language. These targeted improvements reduced user friction, strengthened trust, and created a scalable foundation for future product growth - without requiring a full redesign.
