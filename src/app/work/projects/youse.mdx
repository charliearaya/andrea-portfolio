## Designing and Building a Product from Scratch
This project was developed as my bachelor thesis, exploring how digitalisation is reshaping personal development and coaching.

As personal development becomes mainstream and coaching moves online, youse brings multiple methods together in one interactive platform, helping users learn, reflect, and grow in an accessible, engaging way.

Designed as a practical everyday companion, the app delivers short, situational coaching impulses that guide users to build habits step by step—focusing on clarity, relevance, and seamless integration into daily routines.

## Persona & User Story Mapping
I created several personas but focused on one key persona for the case study. Their journey was mapped together with the emotions at each stage, helping identify where users feel motivated, uncertain, or need support. This guided the core decisions in the prototype.

## Navigation & Structure
The app is structured around three core areas - Discover, Do, and Understand -with the home screen as the central starting point.

* Discover offers search and training units
* Do focuses on actions, mood changes, and planning tools
* Understand includes Learnings, progress reports, and a done list with suggestions

This keeps the app simple at first while allowing it to grow with the user.

## Early Wireframes
Quick hand-drawn wireframes. Sketching fast keeps the process flexible, sparks more ideas, and helps identify what works before moving into detailed design.

## Color Concept & Imagery
The color system is based on four core colors chosen for their warm, light, and approachable character. Because individuality was important for the target group, users can mix and match these colors to define their own main and accent tones, creating a personal look and feel within the app.

The imagery is neutral and authentic, featuring people with no camera-facing gaze to maintain openness and avoid emotional bias. Soft compositions, calm moods create a clear, understated visual atmosphere with plenty of breathing room.

## UI Components
Subtle neumorphic elements add a light, modern, tactile feel while keeping the interface clean and structured.

## Website & Marketing

## Building a Strong Theoretical Foundation
As this was a bachelor thesis, the product was never developed, but the project covered the full design process up to a functional prototype. In a real-world setting, I would have introduced user testing much earlier and iterated continuously to validate what works, refine weak points, and shape the concept based on real user behavior. The project still provided a complete foundation for how the product could evolve into a fully usable digital experience.
