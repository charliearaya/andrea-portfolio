## Brand Identity Built for Small Teams
Monitor Capital Markets (MCM) needed a fast, professional brand presence to support early investor outreach. While working at NewGlue - a platform focused on quick, affordable branding for small businesses - I delivered a full identity package at minimal cost. That included MCM’s logo, pitch deck and Website.

## Logo Design & Typography
The first deliverable for MCM was the logo. This included defining both the wordmark and the logomark, establishing how they relate spatially, and selecting the right typography to match the company’s tone.

I worked closely with the client, developing several variations and sending curated options for review so we could quickly narrow in on the final direction. This iterative process ensured the identity felt intentional, balanced, and ready to extend into the pitch deck and website that followed.

As a finance-oriented business, MCM needed a wordmark that immediately communicates trust, stability, and credibility. The typography had to feel classical and serious, yet still contemporary enough to fit a modern capital-markets brand.

### Company Presentation

After the logo was approved, I created a clean, investor-focused pitch deck that applied the new branding with simple layouts and a clear visual hierarchy.

To handle the typical issues - multiple use cases, different presentation tools, and the risk of inconsistent edits - I built a deck that stayed stable across PowerPoint, Keynote, and PDF. Clear structure, locked-in styling, and flexible templates ensured the brand remained consistent no matter who updated the slides or where it was presented.

### Navigation & Structure Improvements
To bring clarity to the product, I introduced a left-side navigation. This gives users a stable structure, makes key sections visible immediately, and scales better than the previous layout.

Building on the onboarding flow, the home dashboard now highlights the most important action: completing the profile. Since matches depend on this information, users are guided to finish their profile right after signup, preventing confusion and empty results.

### Web Design
For the website, the goal was speed and clarity. I used a WordPress UX builder to translate the new brand into a simple, structured layout that communicated MCM’s offering without unnecessary complexity. The result was a clean, lightweight site that the client could easily maintain and update.

The project resulted in a cohesive brand foundation across logo, pitch deck, and website, giving MCM a professional and credible presence.

A key learning was how to present and articulate design decisions to highly involved founders, especially in a startup context with tight budget constraints. By curating options, framing trade-offs, and guiding discussions around intent rather than taste, the process remained focused and efficient while building trust in the final outcome.
